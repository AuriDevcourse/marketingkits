This tool is designed for TechBBQ attendees to generate personalized visuals for sharing on LinkedIn and Instagram.

The user selects a background (bg1â€“bg6), uploads their photo, and inputs their info. Their image is placed behind a decorative cutout with a gradient border. Text and layout match the official TechBBQ design.

The final image can be downloaded as a JPG.
